#*NOTE:*
All of these are slides from the Coursera Course "Control of Mobile Robots" by Georgia Tech. (Currently unavailable on coursera).

MODULES:
This comprises of the main lecture slides you would have to go through. Every module contains content of one week.

GLUE LECTURES:
This is what you will have to go through after completing the respective week's content. This is a recap and some short notes of everything covered in one week.

SIMULATOR:
This has all the information about how to implement and simulate the written code (mainly in MATLAB). Again, you will have to refer this during every week's module. But most of it should be implemented by you. Everything that is part of this is just for reference.

HARDWARE:
Note: This is not part of the main course.
This is designed specifically for the "Chipera" Robot and other instruments developed and used in Georgia Tech. But it is suggested to go through them for ideas.
